This project presents a retail sales dashboard created using Power BI for DMart. The goal was to analyze sales performance, profitability, and trends using interactive visuals.

What I Did
Imported raw sales data from a CSV file.

Cleaned and formatted the dataset for analysis.

Created a Date table and set up data model relationships.

Developed DAX measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin.

Built visualizations including KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables.

 Outcome
The final dashboard provided DMart’s sales data in a visually understandable format, enabling quick insights into business performance. It can be used by management to track trends, identify top-performing categories, and make strategic decisions.
